# Known gaps

Behaviours that are explicitly NOT expected at the current state of
kaleidoscope. We do not write expectations against these surfaces; doing so
would produce false negatives because the feature is not built yet, or false
positives because the feature exists only as scaffolding.

Source: inter-session feed from the kaleidoscope-developing session,
2026-05-06. Each entry below should be revisited when its referenced phase or
component graduates.

## N1 — TLS / SPIFFE

Knobs exist in aperture's config schema but are off by default at v0.
The schema validator currently rejects `tls.enabled = true`. This belongs
to **Phase 2 / Aegis**.

External anchor: `docs/product/architecture/adr-0008-aperture-configuration-schema.md`,
section "Decision" (TLS/SPIFFE forward-compat knobs, default off).

## N2 — Spark on HTTP/protobuf

Spark v0 uses gRPC by default. HTTP/protobuf transport on the SDK side ships
in **v0.1+**. Until then, S-prefixed expectations assume gRPC.

## N3 — Auto-instrumentation of HTTP / DB clients

Out of scope until **v0.2+**. Spark v0 only auto-instruments what is wired in
the canonical config; HTTP and DB client crates are not yet hooked.

## N4 — Schema validation beyond bytes-conformance

Strict semantic-conventions validation is the domain of **Codex**, a Phase 0+
component that does not yet exist as code. Conformance today is bytes-level
only (`otlp-conformance-harness`).

## N5 — Drained / dropped count integers in shutdown logs

At v0 the shutdown event payload uses the literal string `unknown` for the
counts, e.g. `drained=unknown`, `dropped=unknown`. The contract is the prefix
(`drained=`, `dropped=`), not the value. Real counts arrive in a later slice.
Expectations S16, S17 and A14 assert the prefix only.

## N6 — Persistent buffer for un-flushed records at process exit

A durable on-disk buffer for records that did not flush before exit is the
domain of **Sluice** in Phase 7. Today, un-flushed records are lost; this is
documented behaviour, not a defect.

## N7 — Sieve as downstream sink

`ForwardingSink` today points at "the next stage". In our harness that next
stage is the otelcol file-exporter sidecar, used as a stable, well-known OTLP
receiver. **Sieve**, the sampling/filtering component named in the
architecture, is the eventual consumer but does not yet exist as code.

## Rescope: H1-H6 (conformance harness library API)

Items H1-H6 from the inter-session feed cover the public Rust API of
`otlp-conformance-harness` (e.g. `validate_logs`, `Framing` enum,
`OTLP_SPEC_VERSION`). They were proposed but excluded from the initial EDD
catalogue scope.

Reasoning. They are library-consumer expectations, not end-user
(operator/integrator) observable behaviours. Kaleidoscope's own test suite
already covers them as integration tests of the harness crate. EDD value-add
is at the running-system surface, not at the library API surface.

Revisit if and only if `otlp-conformance-harness` is published as a
public Apache-2.0 library that third-party crates embed; at that point
"library consumer" becomes a real external user.
