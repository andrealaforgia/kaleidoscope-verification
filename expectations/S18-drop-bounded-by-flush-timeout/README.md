# S18 — drop-bounded-by-flush-timeout

## Surface

Spark (auto-instrumentation SDK). integrator-facing.

## Behaviour

Total drop time is bounded by flush_timeout (default 5 s). The contract is "blocks at most flush_timeout + epsilon"; the source feed phrasing "never blocks indefinitely" is not falsifiable in finite time, so the assertion is the bounded one.

The full Given/When/Then contract is to be tightened during pilot
verification against the external anchor identified below.

## Source

- Inter-session feed (other claude session, 2026-05-06): item **S18**.
- External contract anchor: **TBD**. Candidates to inspect, in this order:
  1. `docs/feature/aperture/distill/wave-decisions.md`
  2. `docs/feature/aperture/distill/acceptance-test-coverage-matrix.md`
  3. `docs/feature/aperture/slices/` (the slice that owns this surface)
  4. `docs/product/architecture/adr-*.md` (the relevant ADR)

If no committed anchor exists at the time of verification, the expectation
is annotated `unanchored-claim` even when the binary passes.

## Verification

- Status: `pending`
- Last verified: never
- Kaleidoscope SHA: n/a
- Kaleidoscope dirty: n/a
- Method: TBD

## Evidence

None yet. Once verified, evidence is captured by:

```
harness/run-expectation.sh S18
```

and stored under [`evidence/`](evidence/) (`verification.yaml`,
`aperture.stderr.txt`, `otelcol-sink.stderr.txt`,
`otlp-received.jsonl`, plus any expectation-specific captures
named by the runner).

## Issues

None.

## Notes

None.
